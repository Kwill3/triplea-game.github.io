<br>A new version of World War II v3 that uses a small, steady flow of cash instead of a large initial bid to balance the game for the Allies.
<br>New national objectives encourage players to compete in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, with front lines appearing in historically plausible regions like the Solomon Islands, Eastern Ukraine, and Norway.
<br>China is preserved as a playable country with a modest setup change and an increased ability to collect reinforcements, including artillery from the Burma Road.
<br>Otherwise, unit types, regions, etc. have all been preserved so that players can take advantage of their previous experience with the World War II v3 map.
<br>Initial playtesting with human opponents suggests that the map is balanced without a bid -- but the TripleA community will be the ultimate judge.
<br>Try it and see what you think!
