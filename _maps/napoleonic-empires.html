<br>Preindustrial Napoleonic era European conquest
<br>
<br>The empires of Europe are at war.
<br>The upstart French Republic has followed in the footsteps of their American compatriots across the sea and cast off the trappings of monarchy.
<br>Can this new light in Europe survive against a host of squabbling adversaries?
<br>Or will it fall victim to its own aspirations for an empire...
<br>Will the Russians be forced to sing La Marseillaise?
<br>Will the English see the Guillotine raised in Piccadilly?
<br>Or will the rule of the monarchs be ensured by the restoration of Louis XVIII to the Parisian throne?
<br>
