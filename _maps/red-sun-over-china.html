<br>Red Sun Over China
<br> by Pulicat
<br> updated by redrum
<br>
<br>This is a mod based on the Second Sino-Japanese War, starting in January 1938.
<br>Will the Japanese and their allies push into the interior of China or will the Nationalist and Communist Chinese and their allies resist the onslaught?
