<br>2 Variants of 270BC
<br>
<br>270BC Cernel Variant (by Cernel)
<br>  A low level reworking of 270BC, mainly to rebalance the units and redefine the round 1 gameplay dynamics.
<br>  It can be seen as an unofficial new version of 270BC, close to the original.
<br>
<br>270BC 40% (by Cernel)
<br>  A mod of "270BC Cernel Variant" (see above) where starting units, productions and the city cost are decreased to about 40%. The ruleset is, otherwise, the same as "270BC Cernel Variant".
<br>  Aims at keeping closely the gameplay of the original, but with fewer units.
<br>  It is an easy to learn and play (but not so easy to master) game, with a detailed suggestions section in notes, written to aid new players.
<br>  Special thanks to guerrilla_J, Dany, epinikion for high quality testing (hopefully the game is well balanced, both for dice and low luck).
