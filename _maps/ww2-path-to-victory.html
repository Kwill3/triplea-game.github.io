<br>A new World War II map, inspired by Global 1940, from the creators of G40 Balanced Mod.
<br>
<br>Features a newly redrawn Russia, China, and Pacific theater, designed to encourage more dynamic and historical gameplay.

<br>Also includes new unit mechanics, such as carriers that scramble, factories that are destroyed upon capture, and combined-arms support for mechs and tanks.

<br>Enjoy!
