## Upgrading from 1.8.0.9 to 1.9

### Game Engine
The new 1.9 game engine will install to a new folder and can be played alongside a 1.8 installation.

### Finishing 1.8 Saved Games
For lobby games that were hosted on a bot server, those games will need to be finished on the 1.8 lobby. The 1.9 bots cannot load 1.8 saved games. Otherwise if you can do direct hosting, the 1.9 game engine can launch 1.8 saved games.

### 1.8 Map Support for 1.9 
Assuming windows, and the old 1.8 tripleA is installed to: "C:\Program Files\triplea", and your user home folder is "C:\Users\Jane"

Copy any maps from "C:\Program Files\triplea\maps" to "C:\Users\Jane\triplea\maps". From there you can safely remove the old 1.8 game engine at: "C:\Program Files\triplea\".
