### Windows
If you are not sure if you have java installed, and you don't know how to install java, download the latest release that comes bundled with java. The file is named,

`triplea_x_x_x_windows_installer_with_java.exe`

Run the installer, and you can now run TripleA from the start menu.

If you already have java 6.0 installed, then you can download the file called,

`triplea_x_x_x_windows_installer.exe`

Run the installer, and you will be able to launch TripleA from your start menu.

You can install and download java from here,

http://java.com/en/download/windows_automatic.jsp

### Linux
You must first install java 8 or later. To test if you have java installed, run this command from the command line: `java -version`

Download the file

`triplea_x_x_x_all_platforms.zip`

Unzip the file to any directory, execute the command,

`./triplea_unix.sh`


### Mac OS X

It costs $100 per year for a Mac developer license that allows you to skip these steps, so please blame Apple for having to do this:
1.  Apple menu > System Preferences<85> > Security & Privacy > General tab under the header "Allow applications downloaded from:"
2. Change "Allow Applications Downloaded From:" to "Anywhere"

Download the latest mac version of TripleA, which will be called,

`triplea_x_x_x_mac.dmg`

Double click on the dmg file, and drag TripleA.app to your applications folder. Double click on TripleA.app to run.
