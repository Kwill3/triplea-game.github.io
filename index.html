      <p>TripleA is a free online turn based strategy game and board game engine, similar to such board games as Axis &amp; Allies or Risk. TripleA comes with multiple games and over 100 more games can be downloaded from the user community. Supports single player vs AI, hot-seat, Play by Email and Forum, and a hosted Online lobby for live play online.</p>

      <p>Recreate World War 2 with the Axis pushing through to Moscow, Japan devouring the Pacific, and the Allies desperately fighting back. Or recreate Napoleon&rsquo;s march across Europe, or Rome defeating the Carthaginian Empire, or Sauron conquering Middle Earth, or even Zombies taking over America! If you have ever played a game where you push little plastic/virtual pieces around, roll dice, conquer the lands of your enemy, &amp; produce new pieces to conquer with, you will be able to jump right into TripleA!</p>

      <p>TripleA is Free Software, and is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.</p>
